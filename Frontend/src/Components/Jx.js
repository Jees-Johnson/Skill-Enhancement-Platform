       <h1 className="mt-5">What is JavaScript?</h1>
       <h3>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to enhance interactivity and dynamic behavior in web pages. As a client-side scripting language, it runs in web browsers, enabling manipulation and modification of HTML and CSS content. JavaScript empowers developers to create responsive and interactive web applications by facilitating actions like form validation, DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, and event handling. It supports asynchronous operations through features like AJAX, allowing data to be loaded in the background without refreshing the entire page. JavaScript is also used server-side with technologies like Node.js. Its integration with HTML and CSS forms a fundamental part of web development, enabling the creation of engaging and user-friendly interfaces across a variety of platforms. In the broader context, JavaScript is pivotal in building modern, dynamic, and feature-rich web applications.</h3>
