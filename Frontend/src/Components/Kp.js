    <h1 className="mt-5">What is css?</h1>
    <h3>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and layout HTML or XML documents on the web. It separates the content from its presentation, allowing designers to control the appearance of elements. CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and declarations to define their styles. The cascade determines the priority of conflicting styles, and specificity rules govern the selection process. Styles can be applied externally through linked style sheets, promoting consistency and ease of maintenance. CSS also facilitates responsive design through features like media queries, adapting layouts for different devices. The box model, a fundamental concept, defines the structure of elements, including content, padding, border, and margin. Overall, CSS is instrumental in creating visually appealing and adaptable web pages.</h3>
